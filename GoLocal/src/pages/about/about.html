	GoLocal is a web-based company that aims to bring people together by fostering a welcoming environment where both locals and people far from home can connect with those close to home, and bridge the culture gap by encouraging genuine interactions and local experiences. Our local guides share with you their skills and passion as they take the customer for an authentic experience in your city while also creating value for themselves.

	<br>
	<br>

	There is a great cultural gap between individuals who are familiar with, and unfamiliar with, their environments when travelling abroad. For example, individuals may not be well versed with local customs, unable to speak the language, or be treated unfairly when travelling abroad in regions where they are noticeably not locals. A secondary problem is that individuals can sometimes struggle to find things to do or places to visit to gain valuable experiences, whether they are at home or abroad.

	<br>
	<br>

	Our solution uses technology to provide a centralized platform which allows individuals, whether they are locals or tourists, to connect with guides in any given geographic region. Thus, this aids in bridging any cultural gaps which exist between individuals who are unfamiliar with their surroundings and those are are familiar with their surroundings.
